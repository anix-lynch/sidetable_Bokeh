# 📊 DataVizPro: Data Analysis and Visualization with sidetable and Bokeh

Welcome to **DataVizPro**! In this project, we’ll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the sidetable extension of the Pandas library, and we’ll visualize the data insights with Bokeh. This combination allows for powerful data manipulation and interactive visualizations, making the data analysis process more insightful and engaging. Let’s dive into the world of data analysis and visualization! 📈🎨

## 🌐 Project Overview

Data analysis is crucial for discovering hidden patterns and insights in datasets, and visualization helps communicate these insights more effectively. In this project, we’ll use **sidetable** for quick and easy data summarization and analysis, and **Bokeh** for creating interactive visualizations that highlight important trends and patterns. These tools will allow us to process and explore data, then present the results visually for better interpretation.
